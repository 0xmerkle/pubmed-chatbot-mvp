# Llama Index + Langchain Agents: PubMed Chat Bot

This code imports necessary libraries and modules to create an AI-driven chatbot for fitness enthusiasts, named "jim AI". It utilizes the LlamaToolkit, ComposableGraph, GPTSimpleVectorIndex, and other components to build a robust and efficient chatbot capable of answering questions about fitness supplements, nutrition, and more. The chatbot is based on OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model and connects to the PubMed database to fetch relevant research articles. The code is structured to load research papers from PubMed, store them in a memory buffer, define an interactive chatbot agent, and create a Streamlit frontend to take user queries and display responses. The chatbot can be initialized, reloaded with new documents, and used to chat with users in real-time.
